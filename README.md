# 42_hive-Ft_printf

A 42_Hive project recreating the stdio.h library function printf.

The printf function is a very robust tool with many functionalities and use cases, however this project was mainly focused on incorporating the following elements;

- %c %s and %p
- %d %i %o %u %x %X, combined with flags hh, h, l and ll
- %% was also included
- Flags #, 0, -, + can also be combined with the appropriate conversion to immitate the original printf function as closely as possibly, along with width and precision midifiers.

All-in-all I learnt a great deal from this project; from parsing of different data types and structures to load management and efficent use of readable, mobile and reuseable code for such a large function.

To check-out some of the cases handled please feel free to 'cd test' directory, run 'make' and './a.out'. Cases will be listed on the standard output comparing the original printf to my ft_printf.

Thanks for checking out my ft_printf.
